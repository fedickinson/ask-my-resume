# Dartmouth College

## Overview

Franklin graduated from Dartmouth College in 2016 with a BA in Government and Anthropology, modified with Economics. His GPA was 3.7.

## Why These Disciplines

Franklin was drawn to the social sciences because of a deep interest in understanding people and systems. His coursework spanned foreign policy and international relations, cultural anthropology and ethnography, and global macroeconomics and financial systems. The modified major allowed him to combine these interests into an interdisciplinary program that reflected how he actually thinks — across domains, not within a single one.

Standout courses included Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, Anthropology of Religion, Colonialism and Its Legacies, Politics of Africa, International Development, Macroeconomics, and Ethnicity and Nationalism. The common thread was systems-level thinking applied to human behavior — understanding how societies, institutions, and economies work, why people behave the way they do, and how power and culture shape outcomes.

## Study Abroad

Franklin studied abroad twice, seeking out programs that deepened his academic interests in different global contexts:

- **University of Auckland, New Zealand** — Focused on anthropology, studying the Māori people, the history of colonialism in New Zealand, and contemporary racial politics. This experience grounded his understanding of how colonial legacies shape modern societies.

- **London School of Economics, London** — Focused on government, studying comparative political systems, European politics, government structures, and foreign policy. LSE's rigorous analytical approach sharpened his ability to think critically about institutional design and policy.

## How Dartmouth Shaped His Thinking

Looking back, Franklin recognizes Dartmouth as an environment that shaped how he approaches problems today. A small, tight-knit student body of bright, motivated people from diverse backgrounds created a community of critical thinkers who challenged each other intellectually. The liberal arts model — studying broadly before specializing — built the cross-disciplinary thinking that now defines his approach to AI product engineering.

The anthropology training in particular gave Franklin a lens he still uses: observe before you assume, understand systems before you try to change them, and recognize that the most important patterns are often the ones people can't see from inside the system. These instincts transfer directly to product work, user research, and building technology that actually serves human needs.
