# Cornell Tech — MEng in Computer Science (AI Focus)

## Program Overview

Franklin is completing his Master of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech, located on Roosevelt Island in New York City. The program is a two-semester, practice-oriented graduate degree designed with input from leading tech industry advisors. It combines rigorous technical coursework in computer science with cross-disciplinary studio courses focused on entrepreneurship, product development, and real-world problem solving. Franklin is graduating in May 2026.

## Why Cornell Tech

Franklin chose Cornell Tech deliberately. After six years in industry as a product data scientist, he wanted a program that would give him deep technical skills in AI and software engineering without overcommitting to a multi-year academic track. Cornell Tech's one-year MEng was the right balance — enough depth to build real technical foundations, structured enough to keep momentum toward his career goals.

Several factors made Cornell Tech the right fit. The program's breadth allows students to take courses across disciplines — Franklin has studied not just machine learning and deep learning, but also AI law and policy, business fundamentals, and trustworthy AI. This cross-disciplinary approach mirrors how he thinks about building AI products: technology doesn't exist in a vacuum, and the best AI product engineers understand the legal, ethical, and business dimensions alongside the technical ones.

Being in New York City was also important. Franklin was already living in NYC and wanted to stay connected to one of the world's major tech and economic hubs. Cornell Tech's Roosevelt Island campus creates a tight-knit community where computer science, MBA, and engineering students take classes together and collaborate on projects, giving Franklin exposure to diverse perspectives all focused on applied technology.

## AI Focus and Certificate

Franklin is pursuing the AI for Engineers certificate, an optional specialization track within the CS MEng program that covers modern artificial intelligence and machine learning, from fundamental algorithms to real-world systems, practical applications, and the risks, ethics, laws, and regulation of AI technology.

He fulfilled the certificate requirements in his first semester alone — a reflection of how intentionally he structured his coursework around AI from day one. Franklin recognized early that AI represents a technological paradigm shift on par with the creation of the internet, and he wanted to dive in headfirst with a strong formal foundation rather than picking it up piecemeal.

| Early Adopters | Methodologies for identifying and onboarding early customers for new products — frameworks, contracts, system designs, and real-world customer acquisition attempts for startup ventures |
| Ethical Decision Making in Management | Normative concepts and principles for moral reasoning in managerial decision making — analyzing real-world cases to identify and resolve ethical issues in business contexts |

## Studio Projects

### Product Studio (Fall 2025)

Franklin worked on a cross-functional team that included medical researchers to develop a machine learning approach for a novel blood coagulation testing system. The team built ML models, validated the approach with physicians, and explored pathways for bringing the technique to market. The project combined technical model development with real-world product thinking — identifying clinical use cases, understanding stakeholder needs, and navigating the complexities of healthcare technology.

### Startup Studio (Spring 2026)

Franklin is currently part of Project Zeta, a team exploring AI-powered solutions in the digital marketing space. The team is in early-stage ideation, conducting extensive customer discovery interviews with marketers, evaluating problems around content management systems and AI visibility metrics for brands, and working toward product-market fit before committing to a specific direction. This mirrors the real startup process — talking to users first, sizing opportunities, and iterating before building.

## Key Faculty Influence

Professor Vitaly Shmatikov, a computer science professor and security researcher at Cornell Tech, had a significant impact on Franklin's thinking about AI. His Trustworthy AI course combined hands-on model building with critical analysis of how AI systems can be manipulated and exploited. The course covered adversarial attacks, privacy vulnerabilities, fairness concerns, and security frameworks — essentially a "defense against the dark arts" for AI practitioners.

For Franklin, this class crystallized an important perspective: AI safety isn't an abstract concern for researchers to worry about later. It's a practical engineering challenge that product builders need to understand now. The vocabulary and frameworks from this course directly inform how Franklin thinks about building AI products responsibly — understanding not just how to make models work, but how they can fail, be manipulated, and cause harm.

## The Cross-Disciplinary Advantage

One of the most rewarding aspects of Cornell Tech for Franklin has been the cross-disciplinary environment. The campus brings together students from computer science, data science, operations research, electrical engineering, and MBA programs — all focused on applied technology but bringing different perspectives.

Taking classes alongside MBA students, engineers, and researchers has reinforced a core belief Franklin holds about building great AI products: diverse perspectives are additive. The best technical solutions come from teams that understand not just the code, but the business model, the user experience, the legal constraints, and the ethical implications. Cornell Tech's structure — a small campus on Roosevelt Island where everyone sees each other regularly — fosters exactly this kind of cross-pollination.

Franklin has built a strong network and community through the program, connecting with people who share his focus on applied technology but bring complementary skills and viewpoints.
