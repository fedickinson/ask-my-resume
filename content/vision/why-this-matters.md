# Why This Matters

## The Craft

Franklin is a craftsman. He cares deeply about whether the things he builds are actually good — not just whether they ship, not just whether they hit a KPI, but whether they work well, serve real needs, and are built with integrity. He'd rather build one product he's proud of than ten that merely exist.

This shows up in how he approaches product work: understand the problem deeply before jumping to solutions, iterate based on real feedback, and care about quality at every level. It's not perfectionism — it's a genuine belief that the best products come from people who take the time to get it right.

AI product engineering is where this craftsman identity finds its fullest expression. The technology is complex enough to reward deep understanding. The products are new enough that there's room to define what "good" looks like. And the stakes are high enough that getting it right actually matters.

## The Convergence

Franklin didn't take a straight path to AI. He studied human systems through anthropology, business dynamics through consulting, data-driven decision making through years of analytics, and now the technology itself through formal computer science training. For a long time, these felt like separate chapters. Now they feel like preparation.

AI product engineering sits at the exact intersection of everything Franklin has learned. It requires understanding people — how they think, what they need, why they behave the way they do. It requires understanding systems — how data flows, how models learn, how products scale. It requires understanding business — what creates value, what's sustainable, what actually matters versus what just looks impressive. And it requires building — not just advising, not just analyzing, but creating something real.

This convergence is why Franklin isn't chasing a trend. He's arriving at a destination that his entire career has been pointing toward.

## The Moment

Franklin believes AI represents a paradigm shift on par with the creation of the internet — possibly bigger. The way people work, create, learn, and make decisions is being fundamentally reshaped. This isn't hyperbole. He's watching it happen in real time: in his own productivity, in his coursework, in the products being built around him, in the industries being transformed.

What excites him isn't the technology in isolation. It's the intersection of AI and human life. How do you build AI products that feel natural to use? How do you make systems that people trust? How do you design interactions between humans and AI that make both better? These are the questions Franklin wants to spend his career answering.

He wants to be at the center of this shift — not watching it happen, not advising from the sidelines, but actively shaping how AI meets the world. And the shift isn't just something he's observing — it's expanding what he himself can build. AI development tools have dramatically widened the range of products a single engineer can create, and Franklin is experiencing that firsthand. The barrier between having an idea and shipping a working product has never been lower, and that acceleration makes this moment uniquely exciting for builders. The window for being one of the people who defines this era is open right now, and Franklin is positioning himself to walk through it.

## The Deeper Why

Underneath the career ambition, there's something more personal. Franklin wants to build a life with purpose — not one he fell into, but one he designed deliberately. He wants to do work that matters, be part of something bigger than himself, and eventually be in a position to make a meaningful impact on how AI shapes everyday life.

He believes the path to all of this is the same: be excellent at a craft that matters. Build a reputation for quality. Be the person who bridges technical depth and human understanding. The impact and the opportunities follow from doing meaningful work at a high level — they're not goals to chase directly.

## What He Wants to Build

Franklin isn't interested in building AI for AI's sake. He wants to build products that make people's lives tangibly better — tools that are intuitive, trustworthy, and genuinely useful. He's drawn to the challenge of making powerful technology feel simple, of translating complex AI capabilities into experiences that any person can benefit from.

Whether that's a personal finance tool that helps people understand their money, an agent that handles tedious tasks so people can focus on what matters, or a system that makes expert knowledge accessible to everyone — the common thread is building things people love and that actually work.

He wants to do this responsibly. Not as a box to check, but because he's studied how AI systems fail, get exploited, and cause unintended harm. He knows that building trustworthy AI isn't just an ethical obligation — it's a product requirement. Users won't adopt what they don't trust.

## The Long Game

Franklin is early in what will be a long career. He's not optimizing for the biggest title or the fastest offer. He's optimizing for the life — a career with sustained growth, meaningful work, and the kind of depth that compounds over time.

The short-term plan is to get into the right role at the right company, where his combination of product sense, technical depth, and human understanding is valued. The long-term vision is bigger: to be someone who shapes how AI integrates into everyday life, who builds products that set the standard for what trustworthy, human-centered AI looks like, and who proves that the craftsman approach — caring about quality, understanding users, building with integrity — is the right way to build in this era.
