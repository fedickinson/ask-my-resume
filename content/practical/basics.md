## Work Format

Open to in-person, hybrid, or remote work arrangements.

## Roles of Interest

Franklin is targeting roles at the intersection of AI and product, where both technical depth and product sense are valued. Titles of interest include:

- AI Product Engineer
- LLM Engineer
- Applied AI Engineer
- Applied AI Researcher
- AI Product Manager
- Forward Deployment Engineer
- Data Scientist (on AI product teams)

He's less focused on exact title and more focused on finding a team where he can build AI-powered products end-to-end with real ownership.

## Company Preferences

Franklin is drawn to teams that value depth and rigor, offer ownership over meaningful problems, and foster a supportive but ambitious culture. He's particularly interested in companies working on AI safety, LLM applications, and products that put AI directly in the hands of users.

He's open to companies at various stages — from early-stage startups to established AI labs — as long as the culture and role are the right fit.
