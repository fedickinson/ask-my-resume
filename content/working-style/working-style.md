# How Franklin Works

## Collaboration Approach

Franklin is friendly, approachable, and always available to communicate with teammates. But he also believes that good collaboration starts with alignment. At the beginning of any project or partnership, he wants to establish shared goals, agree on a framework for how to get there, and make sure everyone understands the larger purpose behind the work.

This isn't about rigidity — it's about making sure the team doesn't waste time going in different directions. Once alignment is set, Franklin is a flexible and engaged collaborator who checks in regularly, adapts as priorities shift, and makes sure the work stays connected to what actually matters.

## Communication Style

Franklin values clear, efficient communication and prefers working in ways that respect everyone's time. He leans toward asynchronous communication when possible — sharing written ideas, documents, or proposals that teammates can review on their own schedule, then coming together for focused discussion once everyone's had time to think.

He's not opposed to meetings, but he believes they should be purposeful. The best meetings Franklin has been in have a clear agenda, a decision to make, and a reason they couldn't have been an email. He's found that with modern AI tools making it easier to draft, share, and iterate on ideas asynchronously, teams can communicate more effectively while preserving time for deep, focused work.

When it comes to thinking through complex problems, Franklin does his best work when he has some time to process before responding. He'll often take in information, sit with it, and come back with a more thoughtful perspective than if he'd been asked to react immediately. This isn't hesitation — it's how he produces his most rigorous and useful thinking.

## Working Pace

Franklin works in focused sprints — periods of intense, high-output productivity followed by deliberate breaks to reset. He plans his goals on a weekly basis for clarity and accountability, then structures his days around when he does his best thinking. He's found that giving his brain space to rest — whether through exercise, a change of scenery, or simply stepping away from the screen — actually increases the quality and speed of his work over the course of a day.

This rhythm is deliberate. Franklin has learned that sustained focus and creative problem-solving don't come from sitting at a desk for twelve hours straight. They come from managing energy, not just time. The result is consistently strong output on the things that matter most.

## How He Handles Disagreements

Franklin believes healthy disagreements make teams stronger. When he disagrees with a direction, he says so clearly and without making it personal. He focuses on understanding the other person's reasoning and incentives — why do they see it differently? — and looks for whether a compromise exists that serves both perspectives.

He's also willing to fight for what he believes in. Franklin will articulate his position, explain his reasoning, and advocate for what he thinks is the right call. But he understands the difference between the time to debate and the time to decide. Once a decision is made, he commits fully and moves forward — even if the team went a different direction than he recommended. Alignment after a decision matters more than winning the argument.

## Collaboration in Practice

At Meta, Franklin partnered closely with a cross-functional collaborator who had deep domain expertise in an area where Franklin was providing analytical support. What made the partnership work was clear communication, well-defined roles, and mutual respect for what each person brought to the table. They aligned on roadmaps and priorities early, checked in regularly, and maintained an open channel for questions and course corrections.

That collaboration resulted in Franklin successfully delivering a complex analysis that required deep understanding of the domain context — something he credits to his partner's clear communication about what was needed and why. The experience reinforced his belief that the best work happens when collaborators understand each other's roles, communicate openly, and stay focused on shared goals.

## What Brings Out His Best Work

Franklin thrives with a manager who engages — someone who shares the higher-level strategy, invites Franklin into decision-making, and treats the relationship as a two-way exchange of ideas. He does his best work when he understands the "why" behind priorities, not just the "what," because that context lets him make better judgment calls and advocate more effectively for what will serve the team and organization.

The ideal dynamic is a manager Franklin can bounce ideas off of — someone who provides direction and context but also trusts Franklin with ownership over how to get there. When Franklin has that combination of strategic clarity and execution autonomy, he's at his most productive and engaged.

Conversely, Franklin is less effective in environments where managers are disengaged, unavailable, or unwilling to share context about what's happening at a higher level. He doesn't need hand-holding, but he does need a manager who shows up — someone who's invested in the team's success and willing to have honest conversations about direction, priorities, and tradeoffs.
