# Why Grad School

## The Decision

After six years in data science — including three at Meta — Franklin made a deliberate choice to step away from industry and go back to school. Not because his career wasn't working, but because he saw something happening that deserved more than a surface-level response.

AI was becoming the most significant technological paradigm shift since the internet. Franklin didn't just want to pick up enough to stay relevant. He wanted to understand it deeply — how the models work, why they behave the way they do, what the implications are for products, for users, for society. He wanted to learn it the right way.

The question he kept coming back to was simple: how could he do that while working an extremely demanding corporate job that wasn't interested in his personal growth? The answer was that he couldn't. Going back to school meant choosing to invest in himself on his own terms, with the time and space to actually think, rather than chasing KPIs for someone else's priorities.

## Why Not Just Learn on the Job

People have asked Franklin this directly — friends, former colleagues, people who care about him. "Why not just switch teams at Meta? Why not self-teach? Why not just get another job in AI?"

It's a fair question. Plenty of people transition into AI without a master's degree, and Franklin respects that path. But for him, the goal wasn't just learning enough to do the job. It was developing a deeper understanding of what's actually happening — the mathematics behind the models, the safety implications, the design principles, the ethical frameworks. That kind of foundational understanding doesn't come from weekend tutorials or on-the-job learning squeezed between sprint cycles.

A formal program gave Franklin something he couldn't get on his own: the space to step back and think critically about AI without the pressure of immediate deliverables. Time to sit with professors who've been studying these systems for years. A community of peers who are equally invested in understanding this technology deeply. The chance to study not just how to build AI products, but why certain approaches work, how they can fail, and what responsible development actually looks like.

He's only doing a one-year program, but the depth of learning and the network he's built in that time would have taken years to replicate on his own.

## The Bet

Going back to school at 31 wasn't an easy decision. Franklin had an established career, a Meta salary, and a professional identity built over six years. Walking away from that felt, in some ways, like stepping into the unknown.

There were real fears to work through. Being older than many of his classmates. Potentially having to start at a lower level when he re-entered industry. Giving up the identity and stability he'd built. The worry — irrational but real — that choosing to learn rather than earn was somehow declaring defeat.

Franklin made the bet anyway. He'd been watching the AI shift accelerate and recognized it for what it was: a once-in-a-generation transformation that rewarded people who invested early and deeply. Since he enrolled, that acceleration has only intensified. The market has shifted even further toward AI, and the foundational knowledge he's building at Cornell Tech is exactly what companies are now desperate to find.

The bet is already paying off. Not because of a credential on a resume, but because Franklin can now have conversations about transformer architectures, training dynamics, AI safety, and production ML systems with genuine understanding — not just surface-level familiarity.

## What Made It Possible

Franklin is honest about the fact that not everyone can make this choice. At 31, many of his peers are getting married, having children, carrying financial obligations that make a year of full-time school impossible. He had the ability to do it — through a combination of financial planning, personal circumstances, and a willingness to accept the short-term cost for a long-term return. He doesn't take that for granted.

## What He Knew Going In

Unlike his first time in college, Franklin went into this program knowing exactly what he wanted out of it. Every course selection was intentional. Every project was chosen with an eye toward building skills that matter for AI product engineering. He fulfilled the AI for Engineers certificate requirements in his first semester alone — not because it was required, but because he dove headfirst into the coursework that would prepare him for the career he's building toward.

This wasn't going through the motions. It was a targeted investment in becoming the kind of builder the AI industry needs — someone with both the technical depth to understand the systems and the product sense to know what to build with them.
