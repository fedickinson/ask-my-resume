# Franklin's Career Arc

## The Through-Line

Every role in Franklin's career has been about using data to understand people and make better decisions. The tools got more sophisticated, the stakes got higher, and the ambition grew — from revenue intelligence at a startup, to political modeling at national scale, to product analytics serving billions of users, to now building AI products from the ground up. Each step built on the last, and each transition was driven by a desire to go deeper technically and closer to the work that matters.

## QuanticMind — Where It Started (2016–2017)

After graduating from Dartmouth, Franklin joined QuanticMind, a California-based SEM data technology company, working from their office in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was a Revenue Intelligence Analyst, working across marketing, sales development, and customer success teams to build data-driven forecasting and revenue intelligence systems.

A major part of Franklin's work was lead scoring and sales pipeline forecasting. QuanticMind scraped LinkedIn data to build profiles of potential customers, and Franklin developed scoring models to prioritize which leads the sales team should pursue — predicting which prospects were most likely to convert based on company attributes, role seniority, and engagement signals. He also built sales forecasting models that projected future revenue based on historical pipeline data, conversion rates at each stage of the sales cycle, and deal velocity. These models gave leadership visibility into whether the company was on track to hit quarterly targets and where the pipeline was weakest.

This was Franklin's introduction to predictive modeling in a business context — using data not just to describe what happened but to predict what would happen next and prioritize action accordingly. He learned how clean data, well-designed systems, and rigorous forecasting could improve decision-making across an entire organization. He saw firsthand how critical data recording and system design were — not just the analysis itself, but the infrastructure that makes good analysis possible.

The role also gave him a front-row seat to startup dynamics — small teams, high ownership, direct impact on the business. He was working at the intersection of data and product in a way that planted the seed for everything that followed.

After over a year in Argentina, Franklin returned to New York with a clear realization: data science was where he wanted to go deeper.

## NYC Data Science Academy — Going Deeper (2017)

Rather than jumping straight into another role, Franklin invested in building a proper technical foundation. He enrolled in a four-month intensive program at NYC Data Science Academy, where he learned R, Python, and SQL — coding seriously for the first time. He built models, completed hands-on projects, and got the chance to apply data science creatively to problems he cared about, including politically focused work.

This was a pattern that would repeat in Franklin's career: when he recognized a gap between where he was and where he wanted to go, he invested deliberately in closing it. The bootcamp projects in political data science directly led to his next opportunity.

## Civis Analytics — Data Science at National Scale (2018–2020)

The political modeling work at NYC Data Science Academy caught the attention of Civis Analytics, a data science consultancy in Chicago focused on politics, public policy, and social impact. Franklin joined as an Applied Scientist on the political team.

At Civis, Franklin stepped into a fundamentally different level of data science. He was working alongside machine learning engineers and analysts, building analytics at scale, creating data systems for producing insights, and managing his own client relationships. The work included election forecasting, A/B testing on political advertising, and developing data collection methodologies that pushed the boundaries of what was being done in the field.

What made Civis special was the combination of statistical rigor and real-world impact. Franklin could see the direct effect of his work on national-scale outcomes. He was applying causal inference and experimental design in high-stakes environments where getting it right genuinely mattered. The experience sharpened his analytical skills and gave him confidence that data science could solve problems that affected millions of people.

After working through multiple political cycles, Franklin recognized that politics was a very specialized niche. He wanted to take the analytical skills he'd built and apply them in a broader context — bigger scale, more diverse problems, a different kind of impact.

## Meta — Product Analytics at Billions Scale (2020–2024)

Meta was the next logical step. It offered the scale Franklin was looking for — products serving billions of users — and the opportunity to do data science in a product context rather than a consulting context. Franklin joined as a Data Scientist in Product Analytics.

At Meta, Franklin worked on the Public Affairs team and later the Survey Operations team, applying his analytical skills to product decisions at a scale few companies in the world can offer. He ran A/B tests, built measurement frameworks, conducted causal inference analyses, and translated complex data into actionable product recommendations. The work required navigating large cross-functional organizations, communicating findings to stakeholders across engineering, product, and policy, and making decisions under uncertainty with real consequences.

Meta gave Franklin something no other experience could: a deep understanding of what it means to build and measure products at massive scale. The experimentation frameworks, the data infrastructure, the rigor required when a decision affects hundreds of millions of users — these are skills that transfer directly to AI product engineering, where measurement, evaluation, and understanding user behavior are critical.

After more than three years at Meta, Franklin made the decision to transition. He'd built a strong foundation in product analytics, but he wanted to move from analyzing products to building them. The rise of AI — and his growing conviction that it represented a generational paradigm shift — made the timing clear. He wanted to learn AI deeply and properly, and he wanted to build, not just advise.

## Cornell Tech — The Deliberate Bet (2025–2026)

Franklin enrolled in the MEng in Computer Science at Cornell Tech, focusing on AI. The decision to leave Meta and go back to school was deliberate: he wanted the time, space, and rigor of a formal program to build genuine technical depth in deep learning, language models, generative AI, and AI safety.

The pattern is the same one he followed when he left QuanticMind for NYC Data Science Academy — when Franklin sees a gap between where he is and where he wants to go, he invests in closing it the right way rather than trying to shortcut the learning.

At Cornell Tech, Franklin has maintained a 3.89 GPA, fulfilled the AI for Engineers certificate in his first semester, and is building AI products through coursework and independent projects. He's preparing to enter the AI industry not as someone who picked up a few tools on the side, but as someone who understands the technology from the ground up.

## The Pattern

Looking back, the career arc reveals a consistent pattern:

- **Each role went deeper technically** — from revenue analysis to statistical modeling to product analytics to AI engineering
- **Each transition was driven by curiosity** — Franklin moved when he felt he'd learned what a role could teach him and saw the next level he wanted to reach
- **Each time he needed to level up, he invested in learning** — the bootcamp after QuanticMind, Cornell Tech after Meta
- **The domain changed, but the core stayed the same** — understanding people through data, building systems that make better decisions, and caring about whether the work actually matters

That pattern points clearly to AI product engineering: the next level of using data and technology to build things people use, at the frontier of what's possible.
