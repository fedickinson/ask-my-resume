# Why AI Product Engineering

## Not a Pivot — An Evolution

Franklin's move into AI product engineering isn't a departure from data science. It's building on top of it. The core of data science — statistical thinking, experimental design, understanding how models learn from data, evaluating whether systems actually work — is foundational to AI product engineering. Deep learning models are, at their core, data science products. They're ML systems with neural networks running complex mathematical operations under the hood.

What changed is what Franklin wants to do with that foundation. In traditional product data science roles, the work often stops at generating insights — analyzing user behavior, running A/B tests, building dashboards, and handing recommendations to engineers and product managers who then decide what to build. Franklin found himself consistently drawn to what happened after the insight: the actual building. He wanted to be the one shaping the product, not just informing the people who do.

AI product engineering is where that builder instinct meets the data science foundation. Instead of serving insights to teams who build things, Franklin can build the things himself — and build them with the analytical rigor and user understanding that most pure engineers lack.

## The Builder Identity

Franklin has always been a builder at heart. Even in his data science roles, he gravitated toward the most product-facing work — shipping features, not just reports. He's the kind of person who doesn't just want to know that a metric moved; he wants to understand why, and then build something that makes it move further.

This identity crystallized during the AI revolution. The field of product analytics data science is itself being transformed — many of the insights that once required a dedicated analyst can now be surfaced automatically through AI. A/B testing, user funnel analysis, experimentation frameworks, KPI tracking — these disciplines still matter enormously, but the role of the person doing them is shifting. Franklin saw that shift not as a threat but as an opportunity: the same skills that made him effective in data science now let him build entire AI-powered products, not just the analytics layer underneath them.

The emergence of AI-assisted development tools has accelerated this further. Franklin's productivity in building software has increased dramatically through AI tools — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and others — which function as superhuman teaching and building partners. The barrier between "person who understands the data" and "person who ships the product" is collapsing — and Franklin is positioned on the right side of that collapse.

## The Anthropology Connection

Franklin studied anthropology at Dartmouth, focusing on cultural anthropology and ethnography. At first glance, this seems disconnected from AI engineering. It isn't.

Cultural anthropology is fundamentally about systems-level thinking applied to human behavior. It teaches you that social systems are bigger than any individual — that even if you swapped out every person, the cultural practices that bind a society together would persist. It trains you to observe behavior in context over time, to recognize that you can't take what people say at face value, and that the real insights come from watching what people actually do — not what they claim to do.

This is exactly what good product work requires. User research, behavioral analytics, understanding why metrics move in unexpected ways — it's ethnography applied to digital products. The best AI products won't be built by people who only understand models. They'll be built by people who understand humans — what people actually need, how they'll really use a tool, and where system-level dynamics create outcomes no one predicted.

Franklin also believes deeply that qualitative and quantitative insights must serve each other. Stories and analogies are what human brains are naturally tuned to process. Quantitative metrics tell you what's happening; qualitative understanding tells you why. Many engineers dismiss qualitative thinking entirely because they only trust numbers — but that blind spot leads to products that are technically impressive and humanly useless. Franklin's anthropology training gives him a lens that most engineers simply don't have.

## Why This Isn't Trend-Chasing

Everyone wants to work in AI right now. What makes Franklin's version different is the depth of his interest and the specificity of what draws him in.

What excites Franklin most is studying AI systems the way anthropologists study human systems. Large language models exhibit emergent properties, personality-like behaviors, and psychological patterns that we're only beginning to understand. The challenge of making AI systems feel natural — making it as easy as possible for people to work with them and trust them — is fundamentally a human problem, not just a technical one.

AI is also collapsing traditional disciplinary boundaries in ways Franklin finds genuinely thrilling. It's making it easier to code and build products. It's making it easier to learn new skills. It's bringing together engineering, design, psychology, ethics, and business in ways that reward people who can think across domains — not just within one. For someone whose background spans anthropology, business consulting, data science, and now computer science, this convergence isn't just convenient. It's the moment where everything finally fits together.

Franklin wants to focus on current technology and how it shapes the way people live. He wants to deeply understand how AI systems work, and he wants to be part of shaping how those systems meet the world during this massive paradigm shift. This isn't a career move driven by hype. It's the culmination of every thread in his professional and intellectual life pointing in the same direction.

## The Convergence

Franklin's background looks non-traditional for an AI engineer. Anthropology at Dartmouth. Revenue intelligence at a SEM startup. Political data science and election forecasting. Product analytics at Meta. Now computer science and AI at Cornell Tech.

But this combination is exactly what AI product engineering demands. Each piece contributes something specific:

- **Anthropology** gives him systems-level thinking about human behavior and the instinct to observe rather than assume
- **Business and consulting experience** gives him the ability to understand markets, stakeholders, and what actually creates value
- **Data science at scale** gives him statistical rigor, experimental design, and experience shipping data products to millions of users
- **Cornell Tech coursework** gives him deep technical foundations in deep learning, language models, generative AI, ML engineering, and AI safety
- **The builder projects** — Budget Buddy, Startup Studio, side projects — prove he can ship, not just analyze

Most AI engineering candidates have a straight CS pipeline. Franklin has a convergent one — and in a field where the hardest problems are about humans and AI working together, that convergence is a genuine advantage.
